## 1. What is Open Source?

- **Definition**: Source code made freely available
- **Key aspect**: Permission to use, modify, and share

---

## 2. Why Open Source?

- **Collaboration**: Tap into diverse expertise
- **Innovation**: Faster iteration and feature growth
- **Reputation**: Showcase skills and build portfolio
- **Sustainability**: Shared maintenance responsibility

---

## 3. Today‚Äôs Workflow Overview

We will:

1. Initialize a public repo
2. Add licensing and documentation
3. Define contribution process
4. Create templates for issues & PRs
5. Configure community settings
6. Run a live demo to tie it all together

---

## 4. Choosing a License

**Tool**: [GitHub license picker](https://choosealicense.com/)
In simple terms:

- **MIT**: Permissive, minimal restrictions
- **Apache 2.0**: Similar to MIT, but includes patent rights
- **GPL**: Copyleft, requires derivative works to be open source
- **BSD**: Similar to MIT, but with clauses on advertising and liability
- **Creative Commons**: For non-software projects (art, writing)
- **Unlicense**: Public domain dedication
- **No License**: All rights reserved, no permissions granted

---

## 5. Crafting a Great README

**Key Sections**:

- Project Title & Description
- Installation & Usage
- Contribution
- Code of Conduct
- License

**Tip**: Add markdown badges (build status, license, npm version)

---

## 6. Contribution Guidelines

- **CONTRIBUTING.md**:
  - How to report bugs
  - How to propose features
  - PR process steps
- **Code of Conduct**: set community expectations

## 7. Issue & PR Templates

- **Issue Templates**: Standardize bug reports and feature requests
- **PR Templates**: Guide contributors on what to include in their pull requests
- **Bug Report Template**: Steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior
- **Feature Request Template**: Description, use case, and benefits

See: https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates
