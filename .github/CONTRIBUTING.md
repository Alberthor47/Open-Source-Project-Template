# Contributing Guidelines

> This does not have to be a very long document, it can be as detailed as you want. The most important thing is to have a clear and concise set of guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Report Bugs

- Use the Bug Report template.

## How to Suggest Features

- Use the Feature Request template.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature or fix/YourFix`)
3. Write tests in `tests/` -- optional
4. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test` -- optional
5. Commit and push
6. Open a Pull Request using the template.

> This were some of the basic workflows for contributing to a project but again, all projects have different needs so make sure to adapt this to your project.
